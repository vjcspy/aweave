# Gitignore Tool Behavior

The `workspaces/` folder contains source code. Business workspaces are excluded from git tracking (`.gitignore`), while `workspaces/devtools/` is tracked. This affects some Cursor tools.

## Tool Compatibility for gitignored workspaces

| Tool | Works | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| `Read` | ✅ | Can read files with full path |
| `Grep` | ✅ | Can search content |
| `StrReplace` | ✅ | Can edit files |
| `Write` | ✅ | Can create/overwrite files |
| `LS` | ❌ | Shows empty (respects .gitignore) |
| `Glob` | ❌ | Cannot find files (respects .gitignore) |
| `Shell` | ✅ | Full access via `ls`, `cat`, `find`, etc. |

## Recommended Workflow

When working with source code in gitignored workspaces:

1. **Discover files** using Shell commands:

```bash
ls -la workspaces/k/stock/metan/packages/
find workspaces/k/ -name "*.py" -type f | head -20
```

1. **Read/Edit** using standard tools with discovered paths:

```
Read: workspaces/k/stock/metan/packages/stock/metan/main.py
StrReplace: edit with full path
```

## Why This Happens

Cursor's `LS` and `Glob` tools respect `.gitignore` patterns. Since business workspaces under `workspaces/` are gitignored, these tools cannot list or find files there.

Other tools (`Read`, `Grep`, `StrReplace`, `Write`) work with explicit paths regardless of gitignore status.

> **Note:** `workspaces/devtools/` is tracked in git and works with all Cursor tools normally.
