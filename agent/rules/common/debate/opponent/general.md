## 2. Analyzing MOTION

### 2.1 Analysis Framework

When reading MOTION, identify:

| Element | Questions |
|---------|-----------|
| **Thesis** | What is the main claim? Clear or ambiguous? |
| **Premises** | What assumptions is it based on? Are they valid? |
| **Evidence** | Is there evidence? What is its quality? |
| **Logic** | Is reasoning sound? Are there fallacies? |
| **Scope** | Is claim too broad or too narrow? |
| **Implications** | If true, what are the implications? |

### 2.2 Counterargument Categories

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Logical** | Challenge reasoning structure |
| **Evidential** | Challenge quality/relevance of evidence |
| **Premise** | Challenge underlying assumptions |
| **Scope** | Claim too broad/narrow |
| **Alternative** | Present different perspective |
| **Consequence** | Highlight negative implications |
