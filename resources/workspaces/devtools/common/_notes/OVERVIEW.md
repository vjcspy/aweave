## Purpose

This topic stores lightweight notes and short-term operational reminders for the `common` scope.
Create a note for informal tracking that does not require a full implementation plan.
Entries can be authored by human contributors or AI agents.

## File Organization

- Structure is currently flat: files are stored directly under `_notes/`.
- Filenames are free-form and should reflect intent clearly (for example `next.md`).
- Notes are intentionally lightweight and can be revised frequently.
- `OVERVIEW.md` is the convention reference for this topic.

## Front-matter Schema

- `name` (string, required): Note title.
- `description` (string, required): One or two sentence summary of note intent.
- `tags` (string[], optional): Search and filtering tags.
- `created` (YYYY-MM-DD, optional): Initial creation date.
- `updated` (YYYY-MM-DD, optional): Last meaningful revision date.
