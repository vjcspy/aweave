# Playwright — Abstract

The Playwright package (`@hod/aweave-playwright`) is a shared browser automation library that wraps `playwright-core` and provides helper functions with sensible defaults for the DevTools monorepo. It exports `launchBrowser()` for standard browser sessions and `launchPersistentBrowser()` for sessions that persist cookies, localStorage, and SSO state to disk across CLI invocations. The package re-exports the full Playwright API (chromium, firefox, webkit, devices, types) so consumers access everything through a single dependency. It uses system-installed Chrome/Edge via the channel option, avoiding the 500MB bundled browser download, and is consumed by packages like `cli-plugin-auth` for SSO cookie capture and any future browser automation needs.
