# Common Devtools — Abstract

Common Devtools is the domain-agnostic foundation of the `aw` CLI ecosystem, providing shared platform infrastructure reused across all business domains. It contains the oclif CLI framework and plugin architecture, the `cli-shared` utility library (MCP response format, HTTP client, process manager for server daemon), a structured debate system for AI agents (CLI commands, xstate v5 state machine, NestJS backend with SQLite, React arbitrator UI), a workflow engine with parallel/race/retry execution strategies and Ink v6 terminal dashboard, a document storage system with versioning, and shared Playwright browser automation. The unified NestJS server hosts all backend modules (debate, dashboard, future features) on a single port with shared auth, error handling, OpenAPI/Swagger, and SPA middleware for serving frontend apps. A shared `nestjs-core` module provides structured pino JSON logging (JSONL file + dev console), AsyncLocalStorage request context, and HTTP/WebSocket correlation ID tracking consumed by all feature modules. The DevTools dashboard system includes a NestJS backend module for workspace config, AI agent skill management, and log tailing, paired with a React SPA frontend (Rsbuild + TailwindCSS v4) for config editing, skill toggling, and live log viewing. Each component is a separate pnpm package following consistent patterns for modularity and independent testing.
