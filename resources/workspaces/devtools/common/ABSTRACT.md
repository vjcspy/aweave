# Common Devtools — Abstract

Common Devtools is the domain-agnostic foundation of the `aw` CLI ecosystem, providing shared platform infrastructure reused across all business domains. It contains the oclif CLI framework and plugin architecture, the `cli-shared` utility library (MCP response format, HTTP client, pm2 management), a structured debate system for AI agents (CLI commands, xstate v5 state machine, NestJS backend with SQLite, React arbitrator UI), a workflow engine with parallel/race/retry execution strategies and Ink v6 terminal dashboard, a document storage system with versioning, a unified NestJS server hosting all backend modules on a single port, and shared Playwright browser automation. Each component is a separate pnpm package following consistent patterns for modularity and independent testing.
