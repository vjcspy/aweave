# DevTools Dashboard Web — Abstract

The DevTools Dashboard Web (`@hod/aweave-dashboard-web`) is a React SPA built with Rsbuild that provides a modern frontend interface for the workspace ecosystem. Its primary role is to serve as the Web User Interface for developers to manage local configuration files and toggle the active state of various AI agent skills. Operating within the Developer Tools domain, it fetches data dynamically from the accompanying NestJS backend module via generated OpenAPI REST clients, ensuring a typed contract across the application boundary.
