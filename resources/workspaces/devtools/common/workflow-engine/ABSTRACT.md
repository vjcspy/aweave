# Workflow Engine — Abstract

The Workflow Engine (`@hod/aweave-workflow-engine`) is a pure TypeScript library providing a `WorkflowEngine` class (EventEmitter-based) for executing multi-step workflows with sequential, parallel, and race task strategies. It includes retry with exponential backoff, stage reducers for aggregating task results, human-in-the-loop input gates, streaming output, and timeout handling with AbortSignal support. An xstate v5 machine manages the workflow lifecycle (`idle → running → completed/failed/aborted`) and bridges engine events to xstate context for UI consumption. The package has zero framework dependencies and is consumed by the workflow dashboard for rendering and by workflow plugins (like the demo plugin) for defining and executing workflows.
