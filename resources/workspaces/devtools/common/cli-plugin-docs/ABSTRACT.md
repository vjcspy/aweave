# Docs CLI Plugin — Abstract

The Docs CLI Plugin (`@hod/aweave-plugin-docs`) is an oclif plugin providing the `aw docs` command topic for document storage and versioning, primarily serving AI agents. Unlike other plugins that communicate via the NestJS server, this plugin accesses SQLite directly via `better-sqlite3` for local-first document management. It supports create, submit (new version), get, list, history, export, and soft-delete operations, with each submission creating an immutable version entry. The database resides at `~/.aweave/db/docstore.db` (shared across projects) using WAL mode for concurrency, and output is available in plain, JSON, or Markdown MCP response format.
