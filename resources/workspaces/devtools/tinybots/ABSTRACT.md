# TinyBots DevTools — Abstract

**Centralized Docker Infrastructure:** Single docker-compose.yaml defining all databases, migration runners, and shared services (Checkpoint, Prowl, LocalStack, Wonkers, etc.) to eliminate duplicated CI setups across repos. **Just Command Orchestration:** Repository-specific just commands in justfiles/ provide one-liner commands to start dependencies, run integration tests, or launch dev mode for any repo. **Seed Data Management:** NPM scripts (seed, seed:clean) populate MySQL databases with realistic test data for local development and testing workflows. **Speed & Safety:** Only resets stateful containers (databases) between test runs; reuses running services for faster iteration (~1-2min vs full rebuild ~5-10min). --- DevTools provides the **local development and integration testing infrastructure** for the entire TinyBots monorepo. It replaces the decentralized approach where each repository managed its own ci/docker-compose.yml with a **single source of truth** for: Database containers (typ-e-db, wonkers-db, atlas-intelligence-db) Migration runners (typ-e, wonkers-db, intelligence) Shared backend services (checkpoint, prowl, wonkers, wonkers-account, kryten, etc.) AWS mocks (LocalStack for SQS) Email
