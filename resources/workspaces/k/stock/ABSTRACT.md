# Stock — Abstract

The k/stock scope is a multi-repo stock platform for Vietnamese market data and analytics. It combines a Quarkus ingestion/API backend (jmeta/stock), a Python feature-engineering pipeline (metan), and a Next.js dashboard (meta) to deliver an end-to-end flow from raw ticks/prices to VN30-level features and UI consumption. Initial global overview generation from: resources/workspaces/k/stock/jmeta/stock/OVERVIEW.md resources/workspaces/k/stock/metan/OVERVIEW.md resources/workspaces/k/stock/meta/OVERVIEW.md Latest notable package-level changes (from source overviews): metan: VN30 feature pipeline completion (collector -> index calculation -> aggregation -> persistence). jmeta/stock: mature reactive ingestion and messaging flows for stocks, prices, ticks, and trading analysis. meta: dashboard conventions stabilized around widget containers, chart components, and local user-config persistence. **Platform Role:** Build and operate stock data ingestion, transformation, analysis, and visualization. **Domain:** Vietnam equities intraday and daily analytics, including VN30-derived feature computation. **Boundaries by repo:** jmeta/stock: service-side ingestion, REST APIs, schedulers, reactive orchestration, and queue-based async processing. metan: offline/nearline data shaping and feature generation pipelines for model-ready datasets. meta:
