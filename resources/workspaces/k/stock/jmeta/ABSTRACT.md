# Jmeta — Abstract

Gradle includes six modules so we can publish shared libraries and feature packages independently while projects/http composes them into a Quarkus service (settings.gradle:13-21). The core flows are: 1. **Symbol market data ingestion:** packages/stock fetches Vietstock listings, FireAnt daily prices, and Simplize ticks, persists them via Panache repositories, and exposes REST endpoints for downstream systems. 2. **Reactive job orchestration:** RabbitMQ queues carry “sync prices”, “sync ticks”, and “build trading analysis” commands. Consumers dispatch actions into the shared ReactiveEventManager, which fans out to effect classes that own the ingest pipelines. 3. **Analytics automation:** A trading-analysis service consumes price data, computes metrics, and persists them; Vert.x schedulers trigger bulk syncs; Slack notifications summarize outcomes or anomalies. **Data model:** StockInfoStockEntity maps the stock_info_stocks table with exchange, industries, and first-trade metadata (packages/stock/src/main/java/com/vjcspy/stock/stockinfo/domain/stock/StockInfoStockEntity.java:7-44; schema created in V1.0.0__http.sql:21-40). **Ingestion:** StockInfoStockService streams Vietstock pages, truncates the table when page 1 has data, and upserts rows inside transactional VirtualUni
