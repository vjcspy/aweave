# Metan — Abstract

**Heart of the package**: StockDataCollector (packages/stock/metan/stock/info/domain/stock_data_collector/stock_data_collector.py) - central data loader providing all foundational data for feature computation. Primary data source for features: tick_candles_by_date() → candles built from actual ticks, containing tick_actions for shark/sheep trade classification. Data sources: Supabase (ticks, prices, stock metadata) and TCBS REST (intraday candles - limited). Core flows: info (prepare market data) → trading (compute features) → Supabase persistence. **COMPLETED (Jan 2026)**: VN30FeaturePipeline - end-to-end pipeline for building VN30 features ready for AI model prediction of VN30F1M. The VN30 feature pipeline is now complete and operational. Key capabilities: 1. **Data Collection** ✅ - Tick data, prices, stock metadata stored in Supabase 2. **Feature Engineering** ✅ - Whale footprint features for all 30 VN30 component stocks 3. **VN30 Index Calculation** ✅ - Tick-based index calculator using market cap weighting 4. **Feature Aggregation** ✅ - Aggregated VN30-level features from component stocks 5. **Complete VN30 Pipeline** ✅ - VN30FeaturePipeline persists
