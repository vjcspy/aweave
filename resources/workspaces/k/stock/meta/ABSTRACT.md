# Meta — Abstract

Purpose: Focused guidance for the projects/stock/apps/web app — how we structure widgets, charts, and UI, and conventions to extend safely. App root: projects/stock/apps/web/ Pages (Next.js, pages router): src/pages/_app.tsx — global CSS imports for grid/resize src/pages/_document.tsx — HTML shell src/pages/index.tsx — landing page src/pages/dashboard.tsx — dashboard grid (RGL) with Cards and charts Styles: src/styles/globals.css — Tailwind base/theme and app styles Dev server: pnpm --filter @stock/apps-web dev → http://localhost:3000 (/dashboard main view) src/components/ui/ — shadcn UI primitives only (e.g., card.tsx, button.tsx). Avoid putting components with business or data logic here. src/components/chart/ — presentational chart components (pure render, no fetch/persistence). Example: CandleFeatureLineChart.tsx renders line chart from provided props. src/components/dashboard/ — container widgets that fetch, map data, and wire UI. Example: StockCandleFeatureChart.tsx handles filters, Supabase queries, persistence, then passes props to chart components. Layout: react-grid-layout responsive grid, imported dynamically with SSR disabled. Card: shadcn Card with draggable header (.rgl-drag-handle) and interactive content in CardContent.
