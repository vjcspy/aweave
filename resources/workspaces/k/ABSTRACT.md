# K Workspace — Abstract

K workspace groups source repositories and documentation for multiple domains, including stock systems and supporting misc services. The docs under this workspace are organized by domain and repository, with OVERVIEW files describing architecture, key workflows, dependencies, and operational conventions for each component. Current coverage includes stock-focused platforms (`jmeta`, `meta`, `metan`) and utility services such as git relay server/vercel apps. Plans and architecture notes capture implementation decisions, migration history, and technical constraints for future maintenance. Use this workspace index to route quickly to the relevant repository overview, then drill into `_plans`, `_business`, or `_architecture` documents when deeper design or execution context is required.
