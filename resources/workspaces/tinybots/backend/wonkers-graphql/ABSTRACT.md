# Wonkers Graphql — Abstract

This README explains the project architecture, the two data-access mechanisms (legacy via REST and new via Prisma Nexus), how schemas are merged, and the key points to follow when contributing. It is written to be simple and clear for developers and AI agents. Provide a unified GraphQL API for the Dashboard. Run legacy REST-based resolvers alongside a new direct DB approach. Gradually deprecate legacy and keep only the Prisma Nexus implementation. Legacy (REST): SDL schema: src/schema/*.ts (e.g., typeDefs.ts). Resolvers: src/resolvers/QueryResolver.ts using src/datasources/* (REST endpoints). New (Prisma Nexus): Root: src/graphql. Schema entry: src/graphql/schema/index.ts exports graphqlSchema via Nexus makeSchema. Context: src/graphql/context/prismaContext.ts adds ctx.prisma.tinybots and ctx.prisma.dashboard. Prisma lifecycle: src/graphql/lib/prisma.ts handles connect/disconnect and builds MySQL URLs from config. Types & resolvers: organized in feature-based folder structure under src/graphql/schema/**. In src/App.ts: legacySchema = makeExecutableSchema({ typeDefs, resolvers }). graphqlSchema is imported from src/graphql/schema. combinedSchema = mergeSchemas({ schemas: [legacySchema, graphqlSchema] }). Result: one unified GraphQL schema, serving
