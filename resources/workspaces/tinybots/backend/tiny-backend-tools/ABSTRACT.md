# Tiny Backend Tools — Abstract

Platform toolkit that every TinyBots Node.js/TypeScript service imports for Express bootstrapping, Kong auth/permission guards, request context propagation, and shared MySQL lifecycle wrappers. Ships cross-cutting middleware (validation, serializer, context logger, async and error wrappers), GraphQL permission helpers, and DI-ready base app classes covering unauthenticated, authenticated, and DB-backed services. Bundles infrastructure helpers (AWS SQS producer/consumer with context-aware tracing, cron job harnesses, resource pools/timers), security services (password, TOTP, email), config loaders, and Awilix async module orchestration. Tests run via yarn test with Mocha NYC; SQS integration depends on Localstack. Node >= 20, Yarn 3.8.7; build emits dist/. Dependency and CI hardening from PR “task/PROD-496-fix-cves” (diff vs 2cc3467): package.json, yarn.lock, and ci/test.sh updated to remediate vulnerabilities and refresh pinned versions. No runtime or API surface changes detected; rerun smoke tests if consumers rely on transitive versions. Serves as the shared backend platform layer for TinyBots services (megazord-events, m-o-triggers, sensara-adaptor, Wonkers APIs, etc.). Any change here propagates broadly,
