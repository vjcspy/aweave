# Tiny Backend Testing Tools — Abstract

Shared integration-test kit for TinyBots Node.js services: MySQL fixture builders, Kong auth probes, and assertion helpers. Targets two schemas: dashboard (accounts, relations, subscriptions, permissions) and tinybots (scripts, interactions). Ships as a git dependency consumed by megazord-events, m-o-triggers, wonkers-* apps, and sensara-adaptor to keep DB test setup consistent. Provides deterministic MySQL seeding helpers so services can spin up representative dashboard/app/script data in integration tests. Supplies AuthenticationTester to assert Kong header enforcement across admin and integration flows without duplicating boilerplate. Exposes minimal test utility surface (expect, createRobot, DTOs) to keep downstream tests consistent with TinyBots domain models. AuthenticationTester builds supertest requests with Kong headers and asserts role-specific access: testAdminAccess(adminId, userId) expects dashboard-user-only access; rejects app/integration users. testIntegrationSingleAccess(adminId, userId) expects integration-user-only access; rejects dashboard/app users. index.ts re-exports the tester, DB setup classes, expect, and createRobot so consumers import from the package root. **DbSetup base**: wraps tiny-tools Database over mysql2 pools, offering query/close. **DashboardAccountDbSetup**:
