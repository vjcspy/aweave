# Wonkers Db — Abstract

Flyway-managed MySQL schema for dashboard and TaaS domains (accounts, relations, subscriptions, chains/orders, devices, ECD/Teamleader links). Only versioned SQL migrations live here; no application/runtime code. To inspect table structures or relationships, read the migration files under src/main/resources/db/migration. Migration files are ordered lexicographically (V01__... → Vnn__...); later versions define the effective schema. Check the highest-numbered migration touching a table to understand its current shape. Fast lookups: rg "CREATE TABLE" src/main/resources/db/migration for definitions; rg "ALTER TABLE <table>" src/main/resources/db/migration to trace evolutions. Key domains: dashboard users/admins, relations and contact data, subscriptions and chains, TaaS orders and hardware types, device management, ECD/Teamleader integration artifacts, and permissions tokens for dashboards/overview access. Add new changes as a new Flyway migration file in src/main/resources/db/migration with the next version prefix (e.g., V55__describe_change.sql). Do not edit existing migrations. Include data backfills or permission grants in the same migration when altering contract-critical tables (subscriptions, orders, permissions) to keep environments consistent. Coordinate
