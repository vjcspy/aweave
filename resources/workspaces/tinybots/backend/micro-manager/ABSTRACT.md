# Micro Manager — Abstract

Express TypeScript service that owns robot script lifecycle (create, version, execute, archive) with v2/v3/v5 APIs for users, robots, and internal automation. Converts legacy v1 scripts and schedules into v2 formats, recalculates durations, writes new records, and notifies schedulers. Relies on MySQL (mysql2), Kong auth (kong-ts), and downstream TinyBots services for scheduling, reporting, permissions, robot status/settings, dashboards, and speech interactions. OpenAPI lives in docs/micro-manager.yaml with example payloads; DI is via Awilix; error handling is centralized in buildExpressApp. Tests use Mocha ts-node NYC with Standardx lint; UT/IT suites cover services, controllers, repositories, and conversion paths. Micro-Manager is the scripts domain service for TinyBots. It stores, validates, converts, and serves executable robot scripts; coordinates scheduled executions; enforces permissions; and surfaces script data to robots, users, and internal automation. It is the migration bridge from v1 scripts to current v2/v3/v5 models and integrates with scheduling, reporting, and robot state services. src/server.ts starts Express on
