Speech interaction service managing voice commands for TinyBots robots, built on TinyDatabaseAppAuthenticated with Awilix wiring. Stores robot-specific and default (hardware-type-scoped) speech interactions linking voice commands to script references in MySQL tinybots database. Exposes REST APIs for robots to retrieve matching commands, users to manage custom interactions, and internal services to bulk-manage interactions by script reference. Integrates with micro-manager for script validation and dashboard robot service for hardware type resolution. Initial overview document created to capture existing speech interaction architecture and API surface. Provides the voice command layer for TinyBots robots: users configure "speech interactions" that map spoken phrases (commands) to executable scripts. Supports two interaction scopes: **default interactions** (pre-configured per hardware type) and **robot-specific interactions** (user-customized per robot). Acts as the bridge between robot voice recognition and script execution by resolving spoken commands to script references consumed by micro-manager. Enforces limits on max interactions per robot and max commands per
