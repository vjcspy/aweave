# Wonkers Accounts — Abstract

TypeScript/Express service that authenticates dashboard admins, brokers OAuth tokens via Kong, and exposes CRUD APIs for dashboard accounts, MFA, groups, permissions, and SSO linkages. Persists all identity and RBAC data inside the dashboard MySQL schema, enriches requests with TinyTools middlewares (validation, context logging), and offers /internal/v3/admin/... endpoints other TinyBots services call for permission checks. wonkers-accounts backs the Tinybots dashboard login and RBAC experience. It owns admin account lifecycle (creation, password & MFA management, deletion), SSO account linking, group and permission assignment, and the issuance/refresh of OAuth tokens. Requests are served through an Express app that extends TinyDatabaseAppAuthenticated, giving it a MySQL pool, Kong validation helpers, and standard middlewares (context propagation, logging, serializer, error handler). Dependency injection uses Awilix so controllers/services are singleton-scoped. Primary interaction patterns: Dashboard UI hits /v3/admin/... endpoints behind Kong. The service validates Kong headers (x-consumer-*, x-authenticated-*) to ensure callers are real dashboard admins before mutating accounts or
