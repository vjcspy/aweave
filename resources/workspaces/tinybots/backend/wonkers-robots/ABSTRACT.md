# Wonkers Robots — Abstract

API surface for managing hardware robots in the Wonkers admin/dashboard domain: lookup, ownership checks, pairing, configuration retrieval, and creation of dashboard robot records. Exposes v3/v4/v5 REST endpoints, validates requests via Kong headers, and persists robot metadata in the dashboard MySQL schema. Owns authoritative dashboard-facing robot records (serial, box number, hardware version/type, relation linkage, ICC, payment refs, TaaS flags). Provides admin and Tessa-owner views plus internal endpoints used by downstream services for linking/migration and robot creation. Delegates robot account state, pairing invitations, config blobs, and credential checks to specialist services while enforcing access control and request validation. GET /healthcheck – express-healthcheck using DB ping. Global middlewares: request/context tracing (tiny-tools), morgan logging, JSON/urlencoded parsing, class-validator DTO guards. PUT /v3/dashboard/robots/:serialId/account/deleterequest – owner auth (Kong USER) credential check; create delete request. GET /v3/dashboard/robots/:serialId/account/deleterequest – owner auth; fetch pending delete request. GET /v3/dashboard/robots/:serialId/account/config – owner auth; fetch robot config blob. GET /v3/dashboard/robots/:serialId/account – owner auth;
