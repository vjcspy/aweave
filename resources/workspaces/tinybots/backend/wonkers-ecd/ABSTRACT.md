# Wonkers Ecd — Abstract

Exposes two authenticated webhook endpoints that translate Ecare Puur and ZSP notifications into TinyBots order lifecycle actions. Maps and validates incoming form payloads, enriches with Ecare user and client data, and calls internal Wonkers TaaS Orders plus Concept TaaS Orders services. Persists ECD client–order relations and OAuth client credentials in MySQL; emits Slack and email notifications via shared tooling. wonkers-ecd bridges external care platforms (Ecare Puur and ZSP) to TinyBots order flows. It authenticates integration users via Kong headers, validates notification payloads, enriches data from Ecare APIs, and creates/returns Tessa orders in downstream TaaS services (production and concept/experimental flows). The service owns minimal persistence (ECD order linkage and OAuth secrets) and relies on other domains for order storage and fulfillment. src/server.ts – bootstraps the app. src/App.ts – DI container, configuration loading, endpoint wiring, email/slack setup. src/controller/ – EcarePuurNotificationController, ZspNotificationController. src/service/ ecare/ – auth, API, mapping, team resolution, error messages. zsp/
