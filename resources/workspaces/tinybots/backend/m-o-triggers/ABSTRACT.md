# M O Triggers — Abstract

Authenticated trigger management API and scheduler for TinyBots robots, built on TinyDatabaseAppAuthenticated with Awilix wiring. Persists event_trigger and event_trigger_setting rows in MySQL; caches event schemas and settings to keep scheduling fast. Cron-driven scheduler locks due triggers, enforces day/time/concurrency windows, and delivers payloads to robot-specific SQS queues. Kong headers and permission checks guard robot reads and admin setting updates; permission service calls flow through PermissionAPIProvider. Baseline rewrite: prior overview lacked metadata; document regenerated against HEAD bcb16de with current routes, scheduler rules, and config defaults. Exposes APIs for creating triggers from upstream events, reading robot-scoped trigger status, and configuring default/robot-specific trigger rules. Acts as the orchestration layer between megazord-events (incoming events), MySQL trigger tables, and downstream robot queues (SQS). Keeps trigger execution safe by validating schedule windows, concurrency, validity TTL, and day-of-week constraints before enqueueing work. src/cmd/app/main.ts extends TinyDatabaseAppAuthenticated; loads configs via loadConfigValue, registers DI container entries, middleware, and routes; starts HTTP
