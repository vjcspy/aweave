# Tiny Internal Services Mocks — Abstract

TypeScript helper library exporting mocks for Tiny Internal Services clients; uses ts-mockito and nock to stub HTTP calls while shaping DTOs with class-transformer. Source lives in lib/mocks, compiled output in dist, typedoc in docs, and mocha/nyc tests in test to keep mocks aligned with client behavior. Depends on tiny-internal-services (1.23.0) and tiny-specs for shared DTOs covering robots, dashboard, Taas orders/subscriptions, signals, sensara, scripts, and notifications. Provides reusable test doubles for internal service clients so downstream services can run integration/unit tests without hitting live endpoints. Covers robot accounts/status/settings, dashboard resources, event subscriptions, device signals, sensara adaptor flows, script metadata, notifications, and Taas subscription/order lifecycles using the same DTOs as production clients. lib/index.ts: Re-exports all mock classes plus input interfaces for Taas orders/robot accounts. lib/mocks/*.ts: Per-service mocks combining ts-mockito stubs and nock interceptors (dashboard robots/accounts, robot accounts/status/settings, device signals, events, sensara adaptor, scripts, notifications, Taas services/orders/activation, user accounts). test/*.ts: Mocha specs exercising
