# Azi 3 Status Check Jobs — Abstract

Stateless Node.js worker that schedules per-robot, per-rule monitoring windows and runs actions (currently alarms) when gaps in events are detected. Uses cron SQS consumer Megazord Event Service; all configuration is provided via environment (config files / TOILET_MONITORING_CONFIG). Supports multiple monitoring rules per robot, each with its own event type, window duration, and action list; state is in-memory only. Overview rebuilt with metadata; prior version lacked commit anchor, so this serves as the new baseline. Code now models **monitoring rules** with dynamic eventType, rule-scoped windows, and pluggable actions (AlarmAction via ActionFactory). Scheduling runs per rule per robot; MonitorWorker routes SQS events by eventType, enabling flexible event monitoring beyond toilet activity. Background job service for AZI-3 status checks: creates daily monitoring sessions for configured robots and raises actions (alarms) when expected events are absent within configured rolling windows. Integrates with Megazord Event Service for subscriptions and alarm events; consumes robot telemetry/events from
