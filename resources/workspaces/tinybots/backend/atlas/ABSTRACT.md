# Atlas — Abstract

Atlas is a batch-job service that copies and anonymises robot script data from the typ-e database to the intelligence database. Uses Python-based NLP tools (Flair, spaCy, pii-filter) to detect and anonymise personally identifiable information (PII) in Dutch text. Runs scheduled batch jobs to migrate scripts, execution data, status checks, and robot references while preserving referential integrity. Critical for maintaining GDPR compliance by anonymising sensitive script content and customer conversations. Atlas bridges two databases by copying robot automation script data from typ-e (the operational database) into intelligence (the analytics/reporting database). Its primary mission is to anonymise PII before persisting data into intelligence, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations while maintaining data utility for analytics. Key responsibilities: **Data Migration**: Incrementally copy new script-related records from typ-e to intelligence in chronological order. **PII Anonymisation**: Detect and replace names, email addresses, phone numbers, medicine names, and other sensitive data in script text using multi-layered
