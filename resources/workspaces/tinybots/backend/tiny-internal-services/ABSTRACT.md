# Tiny Internal Services — Abstract

**TL;DR**: Shared TypeScript SDK that centralizes Tinybots domain models and service clients (robots, Taas orders, subscriptions, Sensara, notifications). Downstream services import these classes to call other internal APIs with consistent DTO validation, logging, and error handling. tiny-internal-services is *not* a standalone HTTP app. It is a “platform contracts” package that exposes: 1. Plain TypeScript domains/DTOs (robot accounts, Taas orders, Sensara payloads, Tinybots events, etc.). 2. Axios-backed service clients that other repos (dashboards, megazord-events, sensara-adaptor, Taas tooling) use to call the actual microservices. 3. A small runtime utility (HardwareTypeLoader) that loads DB-provided hardware types into strongly typed data classes via tiny-backend-tools. Because all service calls funnel through this SDK, it enforces logging with IRequestContext, normalized tb-ts-http-errors, and shared enums (for example TinybotsEvent). It therefore sits in the middle of many flows: onboarding robots, linking Taas subscriptions, relaying Sensara alarms, running notification jobs, or manipulating dashboard accounts. lib/model/events provides DTOs for megazord-events
