# Sensara Adaptor — Abstract

Node.js/TypeScript adaptor linking Sensara resident telemetry to TinyBots via SSE ingestion, pollers, and admin APIs. Maintains resident<->robot bindings, posts TinyBots events for ADL, location, and notifications, and persists Sensara events and pilot reports into MySQL (tinybots analytics). Long-running jobs keep Sensara streams live (main test), restart pollers, and alert Slack when ingestion stalls or API calls fail. Previous overview lacked metadata; refreshed against commit 3258c9d. Added /internal/v2/sensara/residents/location/register with RegisterLocationPollV2Dto to fire specific IN_* TinyBots events from Sensara LOCATION_* labels via LocationEventMapper, alongside the legacy hearing-range poller. Location poller creation now accepts optional event mapping, letting pollers emit precise room-level events in addition to CLIENT_IN_HEARING_RANGE. Backend service that translates Sensara activity/location into TinyBots events, persists telemetry, and exposes admin/internal endpoints for resident onboarding, notifications, poller scheduling, and reporting. Built on tiny-backend-tools TinyDatabaseAppAuthenticatedPermissions, inheriting context/logging, validation, permissions, and DB wiring (src/App.ts). src/App.ts sets DI container, middleware, routes, and start/stop lifecycle; resolves controllers/jobs
