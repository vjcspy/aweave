# Wonkers Api — Abstract

Dashboard-facing REST API for account auth, subscriptions, robots, relations, contacts, and overview dashboards; also exposes admin/internal endpoints consumed by gateways and automation jobs. Backed by MySQL dashboard schema, with Kong OAuth/headers for auth, Nodemailer for transactional email, and cross-service calls to Checkpoint robot service and Tinman robots-online heartbeat. Uses awilix DI to wire repositories/services/controllers; request validation via express-joi-validation and Joi schemas in api/schemas. Includes an activation/ job runner that syncs pending registrations, subscriptions, and Teamleader CRM data and triggers robot/account activation workflows. Tests run with Mocha/Chai/Supertest NYC coverage gates (≥90% statements/functions/lines, ≥80% branches). Provides authenticated Dashboard user and admin APIs to manage accounts, MFA, relations, robots, subscriptions, and high-level overviews for “Tessa owner” customers. Serves as the contract surface for other TinyBots services (e.g., wonkers-graphql, automation pipelines) through /internal endpoints and the OpenAPI spec at docs/wonkers-api.yaml. Separates web API runtime from batch activation/sync jobs housed under activation/. server.js – Express
