# TinyBots Workspace — Abstract

TinyBots is a set of backend services, frontend apps, and Wonkers apps for telemetry, automation, and TaaS order flows. This overview lists all discovered repositories grouped by role with links to their repo overviews. Use the coverage table to spot missing repo overviews quickly. Telemetry from robots and partners is ingested, evaluated, and dispatched to downstream automation and order flows. Customer and admin surfaces expose REST and GraphQL gateways backed by shared schemas and database migrations. Shared libraries and tooling standardize middleware, HTTP clients, and contracts for consistent integrations. azi-3-status-check: Status check API and evaluation workflows (resources/workspaces/tinybots/backend/azi-3-status-check/OVERVIEW.md) eve: Schedule management service for Tessa robots (resources/workspaces/tinybots/backend/eve/OVERVIEW.md) herbie: Background cleanup of expired user and robot accounts (resources/workspaces/tinybots/backend/herbie/OVERVIEW.md) m-o-triggers: Trigger scheduling and queue fan-out (resources/workspaces/tinybots/backend/m-o-triggers/OVERVIEW.md) megazord-events: Event intake and fan-out for robot telemetry (resources/workspaces/tinybots/backend/megazord-events/OVERVIEW.md) micro-manager: Robot script lifecycle and execution service (resources/workspaces/tinybots/backend/micro-manager/OVERVIEW.md) sensara-adaptor: Sensara telemetry bridge into TinyBots events (resources/workspaces/tinybots/backend/sensara-adaptor/OVERVIEW.md) wadsworth: Speech interaction
